- [ ] Layout System: The guide doesn't cover the layout system using `Row`, `Column`, and `Grid` classes. These are powerful tools for organizing multiple plots and widgets.

- [ ] Caching: The `cache` function and `CachedObject` class aren't explained. This could be useful for performance optimization when dealing with large datasets.

- [ ] Custom JavaScript Functions: While there are examples using `Plot.js()`, a more detailed explanation of how to write and use custom JavaScript functions within GenStudio plots could be beneficial.

- [ ] Error Handling and Debugging: Tips on common errors, how to debug plots, and best practices for error handling aren't covered.

- [ ] Advanced Customization: More complex examples of customizing plots beyond basic options, such as custom scales, axes, or legends.

- [ ] Data Manipulation: Examples of how to preprocess or transform data before plotting, especially using Python data manipulation libraries like pandas.

- [x] Exporting and Saving: Information on how to save plots as images or HTML files using the `save_html` and `save_image` methods.

- [ ] Performance Considerations: Guidelines on optimizing performance for large datasets or complex visualizations.

- [ ] Faceting and Small Multiples: The `small_multiples` function isn't covered in the current guide.

- [ ] Geospatial Plotting: The guide doesn't cover the geospatial capabilities of GenStudio, such as the `geo`, `geoCentroid`, and `graticule` functions.

- [ ] Interactive Legends and Tooltips: More detailed examples of creating and customizing interactive elements like legends and tooltips.

- [ ] Real-world Use Cases: Complex, real-world examples that combine multiple features of GenStudio to solve actual data visualization problems.

- [ ] Comparison with Observable Plot: A section comparing GenStudio syntax and capabilities with native Observable Plot could help users transitioning between the two.

Adding these topics would provide a more comprehensive overview of GenStudio's capabilities and help users leverage the full power of the library.
